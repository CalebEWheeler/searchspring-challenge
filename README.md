Hi there,

Welcome to my repository for the SearchSpring take home challenge! I had fun learning how to traverse through SearchSprings API, retrieving items and displaying the returned results to the page!

Before beginning this challenge I took some time to try to find out how I wanted to go about the project. James had let me know that I had free reign to use any frontend frameworks I wished, but it wasn't expected of me to build a full application.
With that I weighed the pros and cons of utilizing Vanilla JS with jQuery, or utilizing a framework like React or Ember.js. Frontend frameworks make creating projects a breeze! For example, Ember.js essentially makes you design and structure your project a certain way, otherwise it will not run properly! It's good because it shows developers how to seperate their concerns and designate files to handle one task, then hand data off to the next file. I also had the option to utilize more modern scripting languages like SCSS to really shorten up my style sheets. However, with the scope of the project a frontend framework could be a little overkill.   

In the end I settled to utilize Vanilla JS with jQuery, as I felt it would be better to revisit the basics and see how far I have come since graduation in my abilities to organize and document my thought processes with limited space. I am proud to say I am pleased with what I have been able to accomplish, even though I would love to implement JS Modules to seperate my concerns and utilize import and exporting! Again, I thought it went beyond the scope of the project, so I opted against it.

After successfully retrieving the main pieces of the project and making the information available in the browser, I took some time trying to think of a theme so I could get some direction for styling. The thought came to me while I was surfing the web for some ideas, and listening to my favorite band, Kings of Leon. The song "Beachside" came on and it reminded me of the trips I would go on with my friend Cameron every summer to South Padre. I remembered riding The Wave, playing pickup basketball games, hitting up the beach, and visiting Dave at Island Native surf shop. 

With that being said I am proud to present my take on Island Native and the products I would think they would carry during the beach season with also off season products available for users to see as well!
